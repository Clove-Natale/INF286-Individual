		<h1>What Is Fiber Art?</h1>
		<table width = "100%">

				<td width = "60%"><span style = "font-family:Arial;font-size:13pt">Fiber art is a form of
				artistic expression that uses fibers such as thread,yarn, fabric, and other textile materials,
				to create functional or purely aesthetic works. This artistic medium blurs the boundaries
				between fine art and craft, encompassing a wide variety of techniques including weaving,
				knitting, crocheting, quilting, embroidery, felting, and more contemporary practices like
				installation and mixed-media work.<br><br>Fiber art has ancient roots, beginning with early
				civilizations using fibers for both practical and decorative purposes. Cultures like ancient
				Egypt and Peru crafted intricate textiles with symbolic meaning, while Asia developed advanced
				techniques such as silk weaving and ikat dyeing. During the Middle Ages, European tapestries
				blended functionality and storytelling, often depicting historical or religious themes. The
				Industrial Revolution mechanized textile production, but the Arts and Crafts Movement revived
				interest in handmade techniques. In the mid-20th century, artists like Anni Albers and Sheila
				Hicks elevated fiber art to fine art, challenging perceptions of textiles as mere craft.<br><br>
				Fiber art encompasses a vast array of methods and materials. Traditional techniques include:
				<ul>
					<li>Weaving: Interlacing threads on a loom to create cloths or patterns</li>
					<li>Knitting and Crocheting: Using needles or hooks to loop yarn into intricate designs</li>
					<li>Embroidery: Stitching patterns or images onto a surface</li>
					<li>Quilting: Sewing layers of fabric together, often creating detailed patterns/imagery</li>
					<li>Felting: Binding wool fibers together to create dense, sculptural forms</li>
				</ul>
				Contemporary artists often use non-traditional materials like wire, paper, plastic,
				and found objects, as well as electronic elements like LED lights or video projections.

				<td colspan = "2"><span style = "font-family:Arial;font-size:13pt"><br>In recent years, fiber art
				has seen a resurgence in popularity, partly due to the DIY movement and renewed interest in

				material, ensuring the medium remains dynamic and relevant in the broader art world.<br><br>
				Fiber art’s rich history and versatile nature make it a compelling and enduring form of
				artistic expression. From ancient weaving to modern installations, it tells stories, preserves
